### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a humanities graduate who decided to learn how to code. Since 2013 I've been working as a web developer, specialising in the front end. I'm most proficient in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build user interfaces for mobile-first websites and web applications, and since 2019 I've been working at [Pixelcabin](https://pixelcabin.io/) building custom ecommerce sites on the Shopify Plus platform.

### For 2021, I'm trying to focus on learning about and getting to use; 

#### - TypeScript

I've been avoiding looking into this for a couple of years now just because it seems at a glance to be something that is going to slow me down more than speed me up but it's clearly becoming something about which no front end developer can remain ignorant.

#### - Vue.js 3.0

2020 was the year I really dug into Vue.js and having primarily worked with React before I've loved the experience, plus it seems to make a lot more sense with how we work with the Shopify platform. The new 3.0 version came out late last year and it brings a lot of functionality that I'm interested in trying out.

#### - Nuxt.js

This is related to my work on Vue.js, although I'm quite happy on the front end, Nuxt looks like a quick way to put together a site with some back-end functionality using a front end skillset.

#### - Advanced Shopify features
 
There are a number of things, some more gimmicky than others, but the two features I'd really like to try out in the real world is the ability to [integrate 3D models into product pages](https://www.shopify.com/blog/3d-models-video) as well as the use of [augmented reality](https://www.shopify.com/ar) to simulate a product in 3D in your home before you buy it.  With the future fortunes of ecommerce inversely related to the global pandemic, it looks like 2021 will continue the trend of more and more shopping shifting online and features like this which allow you to get a better feel for the product before buying will definitely be useful.
