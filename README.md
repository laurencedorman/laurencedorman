### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a humanities graduate who decided to learn how to code. Since 2013 I've been working as a web developer, specialising in the front end. I'm most proficient in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build user interfaces for mobile-first websites and web applications, and since 2019 I've been working at [Pixelcabin](https://pixelcabin.io/) building custom ecommerce sites on the Shopify Plus platform.
