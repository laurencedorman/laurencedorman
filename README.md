### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a humanities graduate who decided to learn how to code. Since 2013 I've been working as a web developer. I'm most proficient in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build user interfaces for mobile-first websites and web applications, but since May 2021 I write Python as well at [Ipso SantÃ©](https://ipso.paris/fr/), where I work alongside my colleagues to improve access to healthcare in France.
